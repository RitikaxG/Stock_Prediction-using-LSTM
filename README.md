We conclude that LSTM models are very bad at extrapolating beyond the training data
i.e to learn data outside its range

Here are some reasons why LSTMs might struggle with extrapolation:

1. Limited Context Understanding: LSTMs rely on the historical context of the input sequence to make predictions. If the patterns or relationships in the data change significantly outside the training range, the LSTM may not be able to capture these changes.

2. Memory Decay: LSTMs have a mechanism to learn and forget information over time. This can lead to a decay of memory for distant time steps, making it challenging to capture long-term dependencies that extend far beyond the training data.

3. Limited Generalization: LSTMs are known for their ability to generalize within the training range, but they might not generalize well to unseen patterns outside that range. If the data distribution changes in the extrapolation phase, the model may fail to provide accurate predictions.

4. Overfitting to Training Data: If the LSTM is overfitting to the training data, it might capture noise or specific patterns that do not generalize well to unseen data. This can result in poor performance when extrapolating.

5. Sensitive to Initialization: LSTMs are sensitive to their initial conditions. If the model is not initialized properly, it may struggle to adapt to new patterns during extrapolation.
